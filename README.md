<p>
  The purpose of this project is to study user behavior in a food product startup. The main goal is to analyze the company's app usage and understand how users engage with the sales process. This will allow for an evaluation of the sales funnel and data-driven decision-making based on the outcomes of an A/A/B tesat. Ultimately, the aim is to improve user experience and optimize conversion rates. The project consists of two parts: studying the sales funnel and conducting an A/B test.

The main areas of study in this project are:

Sales Funnel Analysis:
The first part involves examining the sales funnel to determine how users progress through various stages leading to a purchase. The analysis aims to identify the number of users who successfully reach the purchase stage and understand the potential bottlenecks in earlier stages. By assessing user drop-off rates and identifying specific stages where users tend to get stuck, valuable insights can be gained to optimize the app's conversion rates.
