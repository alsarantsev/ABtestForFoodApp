# User Behavior Analysis by using A/B test
<p>
  The purpose of this project is to study user behavior in a food product startup. The main goal is to analyze the company's app usage and understand how users engage with the sales process. This will allow for an evaluation of the sales funnel and data-driven decision-making based on the outcomes of an A/B test. Ultimately, the aim is to improve user experience and optimize conversion rates. The project consists of two parts: studying the sales funnel and conducting an A/B test.

<p><h2>Questions</h2>

The main areas of study in this project are:

1. Sales Funnel Analysis:
The first part involves examining the sales funnel to determine how users progress through various stages leading to a purchase. The analysis aims to identify the number of users who successfully reach the purchase stage and understand the potential bottlenecks in earlier stages. By assessing user drop-off rates and identifying specific stages where users tend to get stuck, valuable insights can be gained to optimize the app's conversion rates.

2. A/A/B Test Results:
The second part revolves around an A/A/B test, which aims to evaluate the impact of changing fonts on user behavior within the app. The design team intends to modify the app's fonts but faces concerns that the new design might intimidate users. Therefore, an A/A/B test is conducted, where users are divided into two control groups (using the old fonts) and one test group (using the new fonts). The objective is to determine which set of fonts produces better results regarding user engagement and conversion rates.

  <h2>Summary </h2>

1. It is noteworthy that the largest portion of our losses occurs between the Main Screen and the Offer Screen, accounting for nearly 38% of the total loss. Additionally, the events that occur after the Offer Screen have high percentages of 81% and 91%, respectively. It should be noted that the "Tutorial" stage appears after payment, suggesting that it is likely the most skipped part of our funnel. Therefore, we will exclude this stage from our analysis.
2. After conducting several A/A/B tests, it appears that changing the fonts did not result in an increase in sales. The sales funnel remained consistent, with a variation of only 1-2% between stages. The biggest loss of leads occurred between the Main Screen and the Offer Screen. Furthermore, the results of all proportion tests indicated that there was no significant difference between the two test groups and the control group, whether they were isolated or combined. Even when the statistical significance level was lowered, the outcome remained the same.
